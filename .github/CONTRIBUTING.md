## Getting Started

0. [Fork the repo!](https://github.com/zen-audio-player/zen-audio-player.github.io#fork-destination-box)
0. Clone your fork of the repo: `git clone git@github.com:<YOUR-USERNAME>/zen-audio-player.github.io.git`.
0. Navigate to the project: `cd zen-audio-player.github.io`.
0. Install test dependencies: `npm install`.
0. If you've started working on an issue, leave a comment as it helps avoid duplicate work.
0. Create a branch(whose name reflect the issue you are working on) and make your changes.
0. Run the tests: `npm test`.
0. Run `git commit` and add your message describing what you have changed. If you have made changes that address an issue include the text `Closes #1` (where 1 would be the issue number) to your commit message.
0. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/zen-audio-player/zen-audio-player.github.io/pulls) - Travis CI will run tests to make sure nothing broke. Once you have committed your changes locally and pushed them to your fork of the repo, a banner with a **Compare & pull request** button should appear on the main Zen Audio Player repo page to submit a pull request. The `base fork` is this repo, and the `base` is master. The `head fork` is your clone of the repo, and under `compare`, choose the branch that you created in step 6.
